This example represents a network with 8 participating nodes.

- AWS (controlling unit)
- generator
- motors (x,y,z,alpha,beta,gamma) - used for rotating the controlled device

The AWS is frequently sending messages to all motors (every 5ms). Every 50ms, the motors will give a feedback to the AWS.
Every full second, the AWS tries to ping every node (generator included) to check whether they are still alive.
Every full second the generator tries to send a whole bunch of data consisting of 7 data-frames.
